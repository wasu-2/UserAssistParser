## UserAssist Keys Show Programs with GUI

UserAssist keys specifically track programs and shortcuts that have a **graphical user interface (GUI)** — essentially, the applications a user launches through the Windows shell, such as the Start Menu or File Explorer.

These keys **do not** track command-line tools or background processes that run without a visible window.

This makes UserAssist keys particularly useful for understanding which applications a user has actively interacted with via the GUI, rather than listing every executed process.

### Summary

- UserAssist keys record **GUI program usage** to power features like the Start Menu’s *Most Frequently Used* list.
- They **do not** include non-GUI or silent/background programs.


Once ran you will get a .CSV file, which then you can use TimeLine explorer to view the information.
